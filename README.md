# Handwritten-character-recognition-using-deep-learning
Handwritten character recognition is the detection of characters from images and
documents and changes them in machine-readable shape for further processing. The
applications of digit recognition include bank check processing, form
data entry,traffic signal recognition and postal mail sorting etc.

The aim of the project is to recognize the characters i.e. English Alphabets(A-Z).We will achieve this by modeling a neural network that will  be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

Language-Python
IDE-Jupyter Notebook
Required frameworks- Numpy,Pandas,cv2(openCV),Keras,Tensorflow,Matplotlib
